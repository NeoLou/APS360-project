When the party disbands after their victory, Frieren casually returns to her \"usual\" routine of collecting spells across the continent. Due to her different sense of time, she seemingly holds no strong feelings toward the experiences she went through.\n\nAs the years pass, Frieren gradually realizes how her days in the hero's party truly impacted her. Witnessing the deaths of two of her former companions, Frieren begins to regret having taken their presence for granted; she vows to better understand humans and create real personal connections. Although the story of that once memorable journey has long ended, a new tale is about to begin.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Kaoru pursues a self-proclaimed Battousai who roams the streets, indiscriminately killing citizens and police officers. Furthermore, the warrior professes to use the Kamiya Kasshin-ryu\u2014a sword style developed by Kaoru's father deeply rooted in the essence of life, not death.\n\nKenshin decides to help Kaoru take down the impostor and restore her father's dojo. Unbeknownst to all, Kenshin is none other than the real warrior whose name still terrifies the people. Although Kaoru eventually learns the truth, his oath to atone for his murderous history by bloodlessly protecting the weak moves her, and she welcomes Kenshin to stay at her dojo. However, Kenshin's ideals are soon challenged by ghosts of the past and enemies of the present.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Ron Kamonohashi, the best student in the history of the elite Detective Training Academy BLUE, has been living as a recluse since BLUE expelled him five years ago. Moreover, he is forbidden to work as a detective, having barely escaped execution after getting involved in a murder case while he was still attending the school. Ron's situation changes drastically when police detective Totomaru Isshiki, following the advice of a senior colleague, seeks him out for help with a criminal case that has remained unsolved for months. Ron reluctantly agrees to help Totomaru and uses his phenomenal intuition to discover the culprit in less than a day. However, it appears that Ron suffers from a mysterious condition that can cause those around him to lose their lives. To Ron's great surprise, Totomaru manages to save the life of someone whom Ron put in jeopardy.\n\nAs the unlikely duo starts solving crimes one after another, BLUE sends operatives after its former student to find out if he has resumed investigative work. Fighting against murderers, rogue detectives, and the Metropolitan Police Department, Ron and Totomaru must join forces if they want to survive and see justice prevail.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Now preparing to enter high school, Isaku is determined to start fresh with an honest attempt at having a normal high school experience. All she wants is to be able to make friends and find love without being defined by her connection to the yakuza.\n\nBut Isaku's dreams are thwarted when her overprotective caretaker, 26-year-old Keiya Utou, takes it upon himself to enroll in Isaku's school by bribing the school administration. While Isaku yearns for a reciprocated love, she is trapped in a one-sided infatuation with Keiya, who only sees her as the boss's granddaughter he helped raise. Her longing for a normal life becomes a constant battle, and breaking free from her heart's grip is far more challenging than it sounds, as Keiya's overprotectiveness and disregard for her boundaries make it almost impossible to move on.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Doing things such as collecting medicinal herbs, exterminating magic beasts and wild beasts, and helping with the villagers' farm work, it's hard to decide whether to call our protagonist an adventurer or a handyman. And while doing these things his age quickly approached thirty. One day while searching the mountains for herbs, he discovered an abandoned child. Thinking that he couldn't just leave the child, he took her home and raised her until his age approached forty.\n\nHis now grown-up daughter had also wanted to become an adventurer, likely from growing up watching her father. Although her father had taught her the sword since she was young for self-defense, her talent at it was quite impressive. Thinking that it would be better for her not to be stuck out in the country for the rest of her life, our protagonist sent her to the adventurer's guild in the Capital.\n\nAfter another five years, the protagonist now in his forties is still acting as a pseudo-adventurer in the countryside, however, his daughter\u2014now a distinguished S-Class adventurer\u2014hasn't returned home even once yet...\n\n(Source: MU, edited)",

The man introduces himself as God and apologizes for his mistake that resulted in her untimely demise, vowing to make it up to Kaoru by reincarnating her into another world. The next world's goddess, Celestine, reforms Kaoru's body and gives her all the concessions she asks for: the body she had when she was 15, the ability to make potions with effects of her choice, and a box with infinite storage space, to name a few.\n\nBut soon, Kaoru realizes that, despite being told otherwise, this new medieval world doesn't have much in the way of magic, causing her potions to be highly sought after by greedy nobles. However, by using knowledge from her previous life, she just might find a way to survive in this world using her potions. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Please make a wish.\" Gorou thought it was malicious spam, so he tweeted, \"I want to do something naughty with my idol Honoka.\" The next day, he is invited by Honoka to pull down his pants in a deserted arcade... \"Congratulations on the fulfillment of your great desire!\" Then, a mysterious girl, Lall, suddenly appears. Confused by the series of events, Gorou is told of a cruel fate. Gorou was chosen by the \"Great Will\" to fulfill his wish, and in order to do so, he and the other Kamisama (God) candidates would kill each other for the title of \"God\" until there was only one left. The first candidate to appear as a potential Kamisama was, of course, Honoka, whom Gorou had longed for. What choice did Gorou make against Honoka, who attacked him mercilessly?\n\n(Source: Official site, translated)",

The show is the ultimate family program and tends to follow traditional themes. Think of this show as the Japanese equivalent to \"The Partridge Family\" and you'll get a good feel for this show's atmosphere. Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\" by adults. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",
